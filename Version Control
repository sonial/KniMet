# EDITS

20 March 2019, v1.2.3
  FIXES:
  - Uniform column names: fixed bug that caused the table at the bottom output port to report the renamed columns in the wrong order. 
  - All the Feature Annotation metanodes were modified to account for some modifications in the latest update of OpenMS.
  - Feature Annotation from internal IMS DB: fixed problem causing fatal error in the flagging step, linked to the presence of empty tables.
  - MVI - all: to avoid columns/rows renaming by the transposition performed with R, met_ID is used as rowID
  
15 October 2018, v1.2.2
  FIXES:
  - MVI - SV: in some cases the replacement wasn't performed with half of the minimum value but with a variable actual value, bug now fixed.
  - Uniform column names now accepts empty selections for columns containing m/z, RT and identifiers, in case any of these columns is not present in the matrix used.
  
09 August 2018, v1.2.1: 
  FIXES: 
    - "Column list loop start" + "Math Formula" replaced by "Math formula (multi column)" in PQN and MVI - SV; 
    - PQN modified to calculate reference spectrum as mean as opposed to median: with median spectrum from all samples, normalisation factors = 1 and data wasn't normalised;
    - "R snippet" instead of loop in Insert missing values symbol;
    - All "Transpose" nodes modified with "R snippet" (more efficient on large tables);
    - LOESS batch correction edited to replace with zeroes the missing values it inserts.
  NEW FEATURES:
    - Feature annotation allows to select a class of lipidmaps and perform annotation only based on that;
    - Feature annotation from internal IMS DB and Feature annotation Internal2External metanodes added to annotate Ion Mobility data with an internally acquired library as well as an external one;
    - QC dilution series-based Features Filtering metanode added to perform filtering of features based on their intensity in diluted QCs.

12 March 2018, v1.2.0: metanodes replaced by wrapped metanodes, added user input functionality via quickforms.
