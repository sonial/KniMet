# EDITS

04/03/2020, v1.2.6
FIXES:
- Added annotation library "LipidMaps_Annotation_NOisomers_noD": all the compounds containing Deuterium were removed to accont for the latest updates in OpenMS 2.5 where different naming convensions are used for isotopes.
- QC-based feature filtering metanode modified to uniform column names internally on the metadata. 
EDITS:
- All deprecated nodes were replaced with the updated versions.
- "Features annotation": all metanodes were edited to show the two possible polarities in a dropdown list, as opposed to having a box where the user had to manually write the polarity.
- Latest version of R were giving issues in communicating with KNIME, this can be solved by installing Rtools before installation of the R library Rserve, as explained in the updated user guide.
- fixed formatting of the second output of all the "Feature annotation" metanodes


13/09/2019, v1.2.6
FIXES:
- Fixed bug in "Feature Annotation from internal IMS DB" that would cause fail. 
- The CheckInstallLoad() function used in several metanodes containing R scripting (such as "LOESS Batch Correction" and "R Source (Table)" performing XCMS and Camera processing) was updated in order to use BiocManager to install R packages from Bioconductor.

17 June 2019, v1.2.5
Edited metanode "QC dilution series-based Features Filtering" to perform filtration based on missing values and RSD in QC at maximum concentration, as wella s Pearson correlation between feature intensity and concentration coefficient.

18 April 2019, v1.2.4
FIXES:
- "Blank-Based Features Filtering" and "MVI - RF": if column (samples) names were numbers, the top output table would contain the columns and values form the input table (i.e. not transformed by the operations performed by the metanode) as well as the transformed values under columns whose name presented a "X" suffix. This was due to a R snippet node to performe transposition of the table, now replaced by a KNIME native transpose node.
- "LOESS Batch Correction": used to fail if column (samples) names were numbers, due to the fact that the SampleName column of the metadata file was considered numeric instead of string.

20 March 2019, v1.2.3
  FIXES:
  - "Uniform column names": fixed bug that caused the table at the bottom output port to report the renamed columns in the wrong order. 
  - All the Feature Annotation metanodes were modified to account for some modifications in the latest update of OpenMS.
  - "Feature Annotation from internal IMS DB" and "Feature Annotation - Internal2external": fixed problem causing fatal error in the flagging step, linked to the presence of empty tables.
  - "MVI" - all: to avoid columns/rows renaming by the transposition performed with R, met_ID is used as rowID
  
15 October 2018, v1.2.2
  FIXES:
  - "MVI - SV": in some cases the replacement wasn't performed with half of the minimum value but with a variable actual value, bug now fixed.
  - "Uniform column names" now accepts empty selections for columns containing m/z, RT and identifiers, in case any of these columns is not present in the matrix used.
  
09 August 2018, v1.2.1: 
  FIXES: 
    - "Column list loop start" + "Math Formula" replaced by "Math formula (multi column)" in PQN and MVI - SV; 
    - PQN modified to calculate reference spectrum as mean as opposed to median: with median spectrum from all samples, normalisation factors = 1 and data wasn't normalised;
    - "R snippet" instead of loop in Insert missing values symbol;
    - All "Transpose" nodes modified with "R snippet" (more efficient on large tables);
    - LOESS batch correction edited to replace with zeroes the missing values it inserts.
  NEW FEATURES:
    - Feature annotation allows to select a class of lipidmaps and perform annotation only based on that;
    - Feature annotation from internal IMS DB and Feature annotation Internal2External metanodes added to annotate Ion Mobility data with an internally acquired library as well as an external one;
    - QC dilution series-based Features Filtering metanode added to perform filtering of features based on their intensity in diluted QCs.

12 March 2018, v1.2.0: metanodes replaced by wrapped metanodes, added user input functionality via quickforms.
